Benchmarking Join Suggestions
===

This repository contains the code used to run a benchmark on join suggestion algorithms.

Datasets are sourced from d3m and augmentation candidates are obtained using Auctus. 
The downstream performance is tested using the ML tasks reported in the metadata provided
by d3m. 

Given the augmentation candidates, additional candidates are generated by creating
new, redudant versions of the already known datasets. This is done to reflect 
real-life data analysis operations and table augmentations. 

# Scripts


# Dir structure
`src` is the root folder for all the code. 
- `src/data_preparation` contains all the code used to prepare the data to be used. 
- `src/candidate_discovery` contains the wrappers used for the candidate discovery part (join discovery and table union discovery).
- `src/table_integration` contains the wrappers to integrate the source table with the candidates produced in the candidate discovery part.
- `src/evaluation` contains the code needed to evaluate the performance on the integrated table.
